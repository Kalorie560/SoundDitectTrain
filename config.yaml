# Colab-specific optimizations (automatically detected)
colab:
  enable_gradient_checkpointing: true  # Save memory during backprop
  mixed_precision: true               # Enable automatic mixed precision
  cache_size_limit: 50               # Limit cached samples for memory efficiency

# Data Configuration - Multiple JSON File Support
# The system will automatically find and integrate ALL *.json files in the data directory
# This allows you to use multiple JSON files as training resources instead of combining them manually
# 
# Supported formats:
# - New format: {"waveforms": [[...]], "labels": ["OK", "NG"], "fs": 44100}
# - Old format: [{"Waveform": [...], "Labels": 0}, {"Waveform": [...], "Labels": 1}]
# 
# Multiple file handling:
# - Single file: Used for both training and validation
# - Multiple files: Automatically split between training and validation based on validation_split ratio
